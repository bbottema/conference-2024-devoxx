# Berlin

**Berlin**[\[a\]](#cite_note-11) is [the capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_Germany "Capital of Germany") and largest city of [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), both by area and [by population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population "List of cities in Germany by population").[\[11\]](#cite_note-12) Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants[\[12\]](#cite_note-13) make it the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union")'s [most populous city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_European_Union_by_population_within_city_limits "List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits"), as measured by population within city limits.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14) The city is also one of the [states of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany "States of Germany"), and is the [third smallest state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_states_by_area "List of German states by area") in the country in terms of area. Berlin is surrounded by the state of [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg "Brandenburg"), and Brandenburg's capital [Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam "Potsdam") is nearby. The urban area of Berlin has a population of over 4.5 million and is therefore the most populous urban area in Germany.[\[5\]](#cite_note-citypopulation.de_quoting_Federal_Statistics_Office-5)[\[14\]](#cite_note-15) The [Berlin-Brandenburg capital region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin/Brandenburg_Metropolitan_Region "Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region") has around 6.2 million [inhabitants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhabitants "Inhabitants") and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region "Region") after the [Rhine-Ruhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine-Ruhr "Rhine-Ruhr") region, and the [sixth-biggest metropolitan region by GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_EU_metropolitan_areas_by_GDP "List of EU metropolitan areas by GDP") in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union").[\[15\]](#cite_note-16)

Berlin was built along the banks of the [Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_(river) "Spree (river)") river, which flows into the [Havel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel "Havel") in the western borough of [Spandau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau "Spandau"). The city incorporates lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, the largest of which is [Müggelsee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCggelsee "Müggelsee"). About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, [parks and gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parks_and_gardens_in_Berlin "List of parks and gardens in Berlin"), rivers, canals, and lakes.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Senatsverwaltung_für_Umwelt,_Verkehr_und_Klimaschutz_Berlin,_Referat_Freiraumplanung_und_Stadtgrün-17)

First documented in the 13th century[\[10\]](#cite_note-Kleiner-2015-10) and at the crossing of two important historic [trade routes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_route "Trade route"),[\[17\]](#cite_note-Verein_für_die_Geschichte_Berlins-2004-18) Berlin was designated the capital of the [Margraviate of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Brandenburg "Margraviate of Brandenburg") (1417–1701), [Kingdom of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia "Kingdom of Prussia") (1701–1918), [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire") (1871–1918), [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") (1919–1933), and [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") (1933–1945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic, and philosophical hub during the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), [Neoclassicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism "Neoclassicism"), and the [German revolutions of 1848–1849](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_revolutions_of_1848%E2%80%931849 "German revolutions of 1848–1849"). During the _[Gründerzeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnderzeit "Gründerzeit"),_ an industrialization-induced economic boom triggered a rapid population increase in Berlin. [1920s Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920s_Berlin "1920s Berlin") was the third-largest city in the world by population.[\[18\]](#cite_note-19)

[After World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II "Aftermath of World War II") and following Berlin's occupation, the city was split into [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin") and [East Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin"), divided by the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall").[\[19\]](#cite_note-20) East Berlin was declared the capital of East Germany, while [Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn "Bonn") became the West German capital. Following [German reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification "German reunification") in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany. Due to its geographic location and history, Berlin has been called "the heart of Europe".[\[20\]](#cite_note-21)[\[21\]](#cite_note-22)[\[22\]](#cite_note-23)

Berlin lies in northeastern Germany. Most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages")\-derived names. Typical [Germanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanization "Germanization") for place name [suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix "Suffix") of Slavic origin are _\-ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch_ and _\-in_, [prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix "Prefix") are __Windisch__ and __Wendisch__. The name _Berlin_ has its roots in the language of the [West Slavs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Slavs "West Slavs"), and may be related to the Old [Polabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polabian_language "Polabian language") stem _berl-/birl-_ ("swamp").[\[28\]](#cite_note-29)

Of Berlin's [twelve boroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin "Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin"), five bear a Slavic-derived name: [Pankow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankow "Pankow"), [Steglitz-Zehlendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steglitz-Zehlendorf "Steglitz-Zehlendorf"), [Marzahn-Hellersdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzahn-Hellersdorf "Marzahn-Hellersdorf"), [Treptow-Köpenick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treptow-K%C3%B6penick "Treptow-Köpenick"), and [Spandau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau "Spandau"). Of Berlin's ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a Slavic-derived name: [Altglienicke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altglienicke "Altglienicke"), [Alt-Treptow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-Treptow "Alt-Treptow"), [Britz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britz "Britz"), [Buch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buch_(Berlin) "Buch (Berlin)"), [Buckow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckow_(Berlin) "Buckow (Berlin)"), [Gatow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatow "Gatow"), [Karow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karow_(Berlin) "Karow (Berlin)"), [Kladow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kladow "Kladow"), [Köpenick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6penick "Köpenick"), [Lankwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lankwitz "Lankwitz"), [Lübars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCbars "Lübars"), [Malchow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malchow_(Berlin) "Malchow (Berlin)"), [Marzahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzahn "Marzahn"), [Pankow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankow_(locality) "Pankow (locality)"), [Prenzlauer Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenzlauer_Berg "Prenzlauer Berg"), [Rudow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudow "Rudow"), [Schmöckwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schm%C3%B6ckwitz "Schmöckwitz"), [Spandau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau_(locality) "Spandau (locality)"), [Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtrandsiedlung_Malchow "Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow"), [Steglitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steglitz "Steglitz"), [Tegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegel "Tegel") and [Zehlendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zehlendorf_(Berlin) "Zehlendorf (Berlin)").

### Prehistory of Berlin

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Prehistory of Berlin")\]

The earliest [human settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement "Human settlement") in the area of modern Berlin are dated around 60,000 BC.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] A deer mask, dated to 9,000 BC, is attributed to the [Maglemosian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglemosian_culture "Maglemosian culture"). In 2,000 BC dense human settlements along the [Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_(river) "Spree (river)") and [Havel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel "Havel") rivers gave rise to the [Lusatian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusatian_culture "Lusatian culture").[\[29\]](#cite_note-30) Starting around 500 BC [Germanic tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples "Germanic peoples") settled in a number of villages in the higher situated areas of today's Berlin. After the [Semnones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semnones "Semnones") left around 200 AD, the [Burgundians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundians "Burgundians") followed. In the 7th century Slavic tribes, the later known [Hevelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hevelli "Hevelli") and [Sprevane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprevane "Sprevane"), reached the region.

### 12th century to 16th century

In the 12th century the region came under German rule as part of the [Margraviate of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Brandenburg "Margraviate of Brandenburg"), founded by [Albert the Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_the_Bear "Albert the Bear") in 1157. Early evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a [house foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(engineering) "Foundation (engineering)") dated 1270 to 1290, found in excavations in [Berlin Mitte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin-Mitte_(electoral_district) "Berlin-Mitte (electoral district)").[\[30\]](#cite_note-31) The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. [Spandau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau "Spandau") is first mentioned in 1197 and [Köpenick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6penick "Köpenick") in 1209.[\[31\]](#cite_note-32) 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.[\[32\]](#cite_note-33) The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the [staple right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_right "Staple right") on the two important [trade routes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_route "Trade route"), one was known as _[Via Imperii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Imperii "Via Imperii")_, and the other trade route reached from [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges "Bruges") to [Novgorod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novgorod "Novgorod").[\[17\]](#cite_note-Verein_für_die_Geschichte_Berlins-2004-18) In 1307 the two towns formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.[\[33\]](#cite_note-Stöver_B-34)

Members of the [Hohenzollern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenzollern "Hohenzollern") family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia"), and eventually as [German emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_emperor "German emperor"). In 1443, [Frederick II Irontooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Elector_of_Brandenburg "Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg") started the construction of a new [royal palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtschloss,_Berlin "Stadtschloss, Berlin") in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").[\[34\]](#cite_note-35) Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when [John Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cicero,_Elector_of_Brandenburg "John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg") came to power.[\[35\]](#cite_note-36) Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League "Hanseatic League") city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran "Lutheran").[\[36\]](#cite_note-37)

### 17th to 19th centuries

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 17th to 19th centuries")\]

The [Thirty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War "Thirty Years' War") between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.[\[37\]](#cite_note-38) [Frederick William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_I,_Elector_of_Brandenburg "Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg"), known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father [George William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William,_Elector_of_Brandenburg "George William, Elector of Brandenburg") as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.[\[38\]](#cite_note-39) With the [Edict of Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Potsdam "Edict of Potsdam") in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French [Huguenots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot "Huguenot").[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)

By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.[\[40\]](#cite_note-41) Many other immigrants came from [Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia "Bohemia"), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth "Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth"), and [Salzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishopric_of_Salzburg "Archbishopric of Salzburg").[\[41\]](#cite_note-42)

Berlin became the capital of the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire") in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [personal union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union "Personal union") with the [Duchy of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Prussia "Duchy of Prussia"). In 1701, the dual state formed the [Kingdom of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia "Kingdom of Prussia"), as [Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_III,_Elector_of_Brandenburg "Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg"), crowned himself as king [Frederick I in Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_I_of_Prussia "Frederick I of Prussia"). Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,[\[42\]](#cite_note-43) replacing [Königsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg "Königsberg"). This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".[\[33\]](#cite_note-Stöver_B-34)

In 1740, Frederick II, known as [Frederick the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great "Frederick the Great") (1740–1786), came to power.[\[43\]](#cite_note-44) Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of [the Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enlightenment "The Enlightenment"), but also, was briefly occupied during the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War "Seven Years' War") by the Russian army.[\[44\]](#cite_note-45) Following France's victory in the [War of the Fourth Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fourth_Coalition "War of the Fourth Coalition"), [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte "Napoleon Bonaparte") [marched into Berlin in 1806](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Berlin_(1806) "Fall of Berlin (1806)"), but granted self-government to the city.[\[45\]](#cite_note-46) In 1815, the city became part of the new [Province of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Brandenburg "Province of Brandenburg").[\[46\]](#cite_note-47)

The [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including [Wedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_(Berlin) "Wedding (Berlin)"), [Moabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moabit "Moabit") and several others were incorporated into Berlin.[\[47\]](#cite_note-48) In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire").[\[48\]](#cite_note-49) In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.[\[49\]](#cite_note-50)

### 20th to 21st centuries

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 20th to 21st centuries")\]

In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the [German Expressionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Expressionism "German Expressionism") movement.[\[50\]](#cite_note-51) In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War") in 1918, a [republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") was proclaimed by [Philipp Scheidemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Scheidemann "Philipp Scheidemann") at the [Reichstag building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_(building) "Reichstag (building)"). In 1920, the [Greater Berlin Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Berlin_Act "Greater Berlin Act") incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [Weimar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_culture "Weimar culture"), Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the [Roaring Twenties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties "Roaring Twenties"). The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin,[\[51\]](#cite_note-52) being awarded the [Nobel Prize for Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Physics "Nobel Prize for Physics") in 1921.[\[52\]](#cite_note-53)

In 1933, [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") and the [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party "Nazi Party") [came to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazis_came_to_power "Nazis came to power"). Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"), and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_architecture "Nazi architecture"). Adolf Hitler and [Albert Speer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer "Albert Speer") developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into [World Capital Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_(city) "Germania (city)"); these were never implemented.[\[53\]](#cite_note-54)

NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [Kristallnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht "Kristallnacht") in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [Sachsenhausen concentration camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp "Sachsenhausen concentration camp"). Starting in early 1943, many were deported to [ghettos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_established_by_Nazi_Germany "Jewish ghettos established by Nazi Germany") like [Łódź](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Ghetto "Łódź Ghetto"), and to [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp "Concentration camp") and [extermination camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp "Extermination camp") such as [Auschwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz "Auschwitz").[\[54\]](#cite_note-55)

Berlin hosted the [1936 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics "1936 Summer Olympics") for which the [Olympic stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin) "Olympiastadion (Berlin)") was built.[\[55\]](#cite_note-56)

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Berlin was the location of multiple Nazi prisons, [forced labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour_under_German_rule_during_World_War_II "Forced labour under German rule during World War II") camps, 17 subcamps of the [Sachsenhausen concentration camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp "Sachsenhausen concentration camp") for men and women, including teenagers, of various nationalities, including Polish, Jewish, French, Belgian, Czechoslovak, Russian, Ukrainian, Romani, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, Spanish, Luxembourgish, German, Austrian, Italian, Yugoslavian, Bulgarian, Hungarian,[\[56\]](#cite_note-57) a camp for [Sinti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinti "Sinti") and Romani people (see _[Romani Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust "Romani Holocaust")_),[\[57\]](#cite_note-58) and the [Stalag III-D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalag_III-D "Stalag III-D") [prisoner-of-war camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_prisoner-of-war_camps_in_World_War_II "German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II") for Allied POWs of various nationalities.

During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 [Battle of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin "Battle of Berlin"). The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.[\[58\]](#cite_note-59) After the [end of World War II in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe "End of World War II in Europe") in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to [Allied-occupied Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany "Allied-occupied Germany") the sectors of the [Allies of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin"), while the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") formed [East Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin").[\[59\]](#cite_note-60)

The

[Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall")

(painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.

All four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") imposed the [Berlin Blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade "Berlin Blockade") on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [Berlin airlift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_airlift "Berlin airlift"), conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.[\[60\]](#cite_note-61) In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany") and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist "Marxist–Leninist") [German Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") was proclaimed in [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"). West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in [Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn "Bonn").[\[61\]](#cite_note-62) In 1961, East Germany began to build the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall") around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [Checkpoint Charlie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie "Checkpoint Charlie"). West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy") gave his "_[Ich bin ein Berliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner "Ich bin ein Berliner")_" speech on 26 June 1963, in front of the [Schöneberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6neberg "Schöneberg") city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West Berlin.[\[62\]](#cite_note-63) Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a [Four-Power Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Power_Agreement_on_Berlin "Four Power Agreement on Berlin") guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.[\[63\]](#cite_note-64)

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the [Berlin Wall fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall "Fall of the Berlin Wall") on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [East Side Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery "East Side Gallery") preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [reunified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification "German reunification") as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city experienced significant [urban development](https://berlinbnb.co/2023/12/16/berlin-wall-urban-development/) and still impacts urban planning decisions.

[\[64\]](#cite_note-65) Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim.[\[65\]](#cite_note-66) City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and [Eberhard Diepgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_Diepgen "Eberhard Diepgen") (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.[\[66\]](#cite_note-67) On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a [reunified Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification#Unified_Berlin "German reunification")[\[67\]](#cite_note-68) (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the [Bundestag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag "Bundestag") (German Parliament) [voted to move the seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_on_the_Capital_of_Germany "Decision on the Capital of Germany") of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of [Gerhard Schröder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der "Gerhard Schröder").[\[68\]](#cite_note-69)

[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin%27s_2001_administrative_reform "Berlin's 2001 administrative reform") merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.[\[69\]](#cite_note-70)

In 2006, the [FIFA World Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_Final "2006 FIFA World Cup Final") was held in Berlin.[\[70\]](#cite_note-71)

Construction of the "Berlin Wall Trail" (Berliner Mauerweg) began in 2002 and was completed in 2006.

In a [2016 terrorist attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Berlin_truck_attack "2016 Berlin truck attack") linked to [ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIL "ISIL"), a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the [Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church "Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church"), leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.[\[71\]](#cite_note-72)[\[72\]](#cite_note-73)

In 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in Berlin with demonstrations of solidarity against racism, in response to the emergence of [far-right politics in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_Germany_(1945-present) "Far-right politics in Germany (1945-present)").[\[73\]](#cite_note-74)

[Berlin Brandenburg Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport "Berlin Brandenburg Airport") (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from [Tegel Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegel_Airport "Tegel Airport") ending in November.[\[74\]](#cite_note-75) Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"), plans were announced to close BER's Terminal 5, the former [Schönefeld Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nefeld_Airport "Schönefeld Airport"), beginning in March 2021.[\[75\]](#cite_note-76) The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station opened in 2021, which completed all new works on the U5.[\[76\]](#cite_note-77)

### Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/DEU_Berlin-Brandenburg_COA.svg/170px-DEU_Berlin-Brandenburg_COA.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DEU_Berlin-Brandenburg_COA.svg)

The coat of arms proposed in the state contract

The legal basis for a combined state of Berlin and [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg "Brandenburg") is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the [Basic Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany "Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany") stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law.[\[79\]](#cite_note-80) However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.[\[80\]](#cite_note-81)

In 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg.[\[81\]](#cite_note-LÄNDERFUSION-2004-82) Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there are over 225,000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to Berlin. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches.[\[82\]](#cite_note-83) Though Berlin voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin"), Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on Berlin's large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.[\[81\]](#cite_note-LÄNDERFUSION-2004-82)

The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.

Berlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography "Topography"), part of the vast [Northern European Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_European_Plain "Northern European Plain") which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The _Berliner Urstromtal_ (an ice age [glacial valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_valley "Glacial valley")), between the low [Barnim Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnim_Plateau "Barnim Plateau") to the north and the [Teltow plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teltow_plateau "Teltow plateau") to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [Weichselian glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weichselian_glaciation "Weichselian glaciation"). The [Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_(river) "Spree (river)") follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [Havel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel "Havel"), which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [Großer Wannsee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fer_Wannsee "Großer Wannsee"). A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [Großer Müggelsee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCggelsee "Müggelsee") in eastern Berlin.[\[83\]](#cite_note-84)

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [Reinickendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinickendorf "Reinickendorf") and [Pankow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankow "Pankow") lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf "Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf"), [Steglitz-Zehlendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steglitz-Zehlendorf "Steglitz-Zehlendorf"), [Tempelhof-Schöneberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempelhof-Sch%C3%B6neberg "Tempelhof-Schöneberg"), and [Neukölln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuk%C3%B6lln "Neukölln") lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed [Teufelsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teufelsberg "Teufelsberg") (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.[\[84\]](#cite_note-85) The [Müggelberge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCggelberge "Müggelberge") at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.[\[85\]](#cite_note-86)

Berlin has an [oceanic climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate "Oceanic climate") ([Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"): _Cfb_)[\[86\]](#cite_note-87) bordering on a [humid continental climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate "Humid continental climate") (_Dfb_). This type of climate features mild to very warm summer temperatures and cold, though not very severe, winters. Annual precipitation is modest.[\[87\]](#cite_note-88)[\[88\]](#cite_note-89)

Frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many [oceanic climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate "Oceanic climate"). Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22–25 °C (72–77 °F) and lows of 12–14 °C (54–57 °F). Winters are cold with average high temperatures of 3 °C (37 °F) and lows of −2 to 0 °C (28 to 32 °F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with [heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island "Urban heat island"). Temperatures can be 4 °C (7 °F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.[\[89\]](#cite_note-90) Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.[\[90\]](#cite_note-91) The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0 °C (73.4 °F) and the coldest was [January 1709](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Frost_of_1709 "Great Frost of 1709"), with a mean temperature of −13.2 °C (8.2 °F).[\[91\]](#cite_note-92) The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1 in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039 in) of rainfall.[\[92\]](#cite_note-93)

Berlin's history has left the city with a polycentric [metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area "Metropolitan area") and an eclectic mix of architecture. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by German history during the 20th century. 17% of Berlin's buildings are [Gründerzeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnderzeit "Gründerzeit") or earlier and nearly 25% are of the 1920s and 1930s, when Berlin played a part in the origin of [modern architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Modernism_Housing_Estates "Berlin Modernism Housing Estates").[\[97\]](#cite_note-98)[\[98\]](#cite_note-99)

Devastated by the [bombing of Berlin in World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Berlin_in_World_War_II "Bombing of Berlin in World War II") many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. After the reunification, many important heritage structures have been [reconstructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_(architecture) "Reconstruction (architecture)"), including the _[Forum Fridericianum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Fridericianum "Forum Fridericianum")_ along with, the [Berlin State Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_State_Opera "Berlin State Opera"), [Charlottenburg Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottenburg_Palace "Charlottenburg Palace"), [Gendarmenmarkt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmenmarkt "Gendarmenmarkt"), [Alte Kommandantur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Kommandantur "Alte Kommandantur"), as well as the [City Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Palace,_Berlin "City Palace, Berlin").

The [tallest buildings in Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Berlin "List of tallest buildings in Berlin") are spread across the urban area, with clusters at [Potsdamer Platz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdamer_Platz "Potsdamer Platz"), [City West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_West "City West"), and [Alexanderplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz "Alexanderplatz").

Over one-third of the city's area consists of green and open-space,[\[16\]](#cite_note-Senatsverwaltung_für_Umwelt,_Verkehr_und_Klimaschutz_Berlin,_Referat_Freiraumplanung_und_Stadtgrün-17)with the [Großer Tiergarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fer_Tiergarten "Großer Tiergarten"), one of the largest and most popular parks in Berlin, located in the centre of the city.

[Brandenburg Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate "Brandenburg Gate") at night

The [Fernsehturm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin "Fernsehturm Berlin") (TV tower) at [Alexanderplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz "Alexanderplatz") in [Mitte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitte "Mitte") is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368 m (1,207 ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the [Karl-Marx-Allee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Marx-Allee "Karl-Marx-Allee") heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [Socialist Classicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Classicism "Socialist Classicism") style. Adjacent to this area is the [Rotes Rathaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotes_Rathaus "Rotes Rathaus") (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [Neptunbrunnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptunbrunnen "Neptunbrunnen"), a fountain featuring a mythological group of [Tritons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(mythology) "Triton (mythology)"), [personifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification "Personification") of the four main Prussian rivers, and [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(mythology) "Neptune (mythology)") on top of it.

The [Brandenburg Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate "Brandenburg Gate") is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [Reichstag building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_building "Reichstag building") is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect [Norman Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foster_(architect) "Norman Foster (architect)") in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [East Side Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery "East Side Gallery") is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [Gendarmenmarkt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmenmarkt "Gendarmenmarkt") is a [neoclassical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture "Neoclassical architecture") square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the [Französischer Dom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz%C3%B6sischer_Dom "Französischer Dom") with its observation platform and the [Deutscher Dom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Dom "Deutscher Dom"). The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [Museum Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Island "Museum Island") in the [River Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_(river) "Spree (river)") houses [five museums](#Museums) built from 1830 to 1930 and is a [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") [World Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Germany "List of World Heritage Sites in Germany") site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums ([James Simon Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Simon_Gallery "James Simon Gallery")), as well as reconstruction of the [Berlin Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Palace "Berlin Palace") (Stadtschloss) were completed.[\[99\]](#cite_note-100)[\[100\]](#cite_note-101) Also on the island and next to the [Lustgarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustgarten "Lustgarten") and palace is [Berlin Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Cathedral "Berlin Cathedral"), emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [St. Peter's Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica "St. Peter's Basilica") in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. [St. Hedwig's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Hedwig%27s_Cathedral "St. Hedwig's Cathedral") is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

[Breitscheidplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitscheidplatz "Breitscheidplatz") with [Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church "Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church") is the center of [City West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_West "City West").

[Unter den Linden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unter_den_Linden "Unter den Linden") is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the Berlin Palace, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of [Humboldt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University "Humboldt University") is there. [Friedrichstraße](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe "Friedrichstraße") was Berlin's legendary street during the [Golden Twenties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Twenties "Golden Twenties"). It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[Potsdamer Platz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdamer_Platz "Potsdamer Platz") is an entire quarter built from scratch after the [Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall") came down.[\[101\]](#cite_note-102) To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [Gemäldegalerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie,_Berlin "Gemäldegalerie, Berlin"), and is flanked by the [Neue Nationalgalerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Nationalgalerie "Neue Nationalgalerie") and the [Berliner Philharmonie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Philharmonie "Berliner Philharmonie"). The [Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe "Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe"), a [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust") memorial, is to the north.[\[102\]](#cite_note-103)

The area around [Hackescher Markt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackescher_Markt "Hackescher Markt") is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [Hackesche Höfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackesche_H%C3%B6fe "Hackesche Höfe"), a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [New Synagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Synagogue,_Berlin "New Synagogue, Berlin") is the center of Jewish culture.

The [Straße des 17. Juni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stra%C3%9Fe_des_17._Juni "Straße des 17. Juni"), connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the [uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprising_of_1953_in_East_Germany "Uprising of 1953 in East Germany"). Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [Siegessäule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column "Berlin Victory Column") (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [Kurfürstendamm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurf%C3%BCrstendamm "Kurfürstendamm") is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church "Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church") at its eastern end on [Breitscheidplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitscheidplatz "Breitscheidplatz"). The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [KaDeWe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaDeWe "KaDeWe"), claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [Rathaus Schöneberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathaus_Sch%C3%B6neberg "Rathaus Schöneberg"), where [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy") made his famous "[Ich bin ein Berliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner "Ich bin ein Berliner")!" speech, is in [Tempelhof-Schöneberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempelhof-Sch%C3%B6neberg "Tempelhof-Schöneberg").

West of the center, [Bellevue Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Palace_(Germany) "Bellevue Palace (Germany)") is the residence of the German President. [Charlottenburg Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottenburg_Palace "Charlottenburg Palace"), which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [Funkturm Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funkturm_Berlin "Funkturm Berlin") is a 150-meter-tall (490 ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [Oberbaumbrücke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberbaumbr%C3%BCcke "Oberbaumbrücke") over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [Friedrichshain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain "Friedrichshain") and [Kreuzberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg "Kreuzberg"). It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [Berlin U-Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_U-Bahn "Berlin U-Bahn") line. The bridge was completed in a [brick gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_gothic "Brick gothic") style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army") from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [checkpoint and border crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_border_crossings "Berlin border crossings") between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes "Edict of Nantes") in France, the city responded with the [Edict of Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Potsdam "Edict of Potsdam"), which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [Greater Berlin Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Berlin_Act "Greater Berlin Act") in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people") and [Turkish German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_in_Germany "Turks in Germany") residents,[\[103\]](#cite_note-Amt_für_Statistik_Berlin-Brandenburg-104) making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.[\[107\]](#cite_note-108) In the 1990s the _Aussiedlergesetze_ enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"). Today ethnic [Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Germans_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union "History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union") from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.[\[108\]](#cite_note-109) The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.[\[109\]](#cite_note-110) A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the [Afrikanisches Viertel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikanisches_Viertel "Afrikanisches Viertel").[\[110\]](#cite_note-111) Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.[\[111\]](#cite_note-112)

In December 2019 there were 777,345 registered residents of foreign nationality and another 542,975 German citizens with a "migration background" _(Migrationshintergrund, MH)_,[\[103\]](#cite_note-Amt_für_Statistik_Berlin-Brandenburg-104) meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955. Foreign residents of Berlin originate from about 190 countries.[\[112\]](#cite_note-113) 48 percent of the residents under the age of 15 have a migration background in 2017.[\[113\]](#cite_note-114) Berlin in 2009 was estimated to have 100,000 to 250,000 unregistered inhabitants.[\[114\]](#cite_note-115) Boroughs of Berlin with a significant number of migrants or foreign born population are [Mitte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitte "Mitte"), [Neukölln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuk%C3%B6lln "Neukölln") and [Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg "Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg").[\[115\]](#cite_note-116) The number of Arabic speakers in Berlin could be higher than 150,000. There are at least 40,000 Berliners with Syrian citizenship, third only behind Turkish and Polish citizens. The [2015 refugee crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis "2015 European migrant crisis") made Berlin Europe's capital of Arab culture.[\[116\]](#cite_note-117) Berlin is among the cities in Germany that have received the biggest amount of refugees after the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine"). As of November 2022, an estimated 85,000 Ukrainian refugees were registered in Berlin,[\[117\]](#cite_note-118) making Berlin the most popular destination of Ukrainian refugees in Germany.[\[118\]](#cite_note-119)

Berlin has a vibrant [expatriate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate "Expatriate") community involving precarious immigrants, illegal immigrants, seasonal workers, and refugees. Therefore, Berlin sustains a broad variety of English-based speakers. Speaking a particular type of English does attract prestige and [cultural capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_capital "Cultural capital") in Berlin.[\[119\]](#cite_note-120)

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [West Germanic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_languages "West Germanic languages") that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages") language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,[\[120\]](#cite_note-121) and one of the three [working languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_language "Working language") of the [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission").

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the [surrounding metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin/Brandenburg_Metropolitan_Region "Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region"). It originates from a [Brandenburgish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburgisch_dialect "Brandenburgisch dialect") variant. The dialect is now seen more like a [sociolect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolect "Sociolect"), largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [standard German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_German "Standard German") in everyday life.

The most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.[\[121\]](#cite_note-122)

On the report of the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.[\[123\]](#cite_note-124)

The largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") [regional church body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landeskirche "Landeskirche")—the [Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Church_of_Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian_Upper_Lusatia "Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia")—a [united church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_church "United church"). EKBO is a member of the [Protestant Church in Germany (EKD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Church_in_Germany "Protestant Church in Germany") and of the [Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD (UEK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Protestant_Churches_in_the_EKD "Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD"). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members.[\[124\]](#cite_note-125) About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church"), but also various Protestants).[\[125\]](#cite_note-Amt_für_Statistik_Berlin–Brandenburg-2010-126) According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church.[\[103\]](#cite_note-Amt_für_Statistik_Berlin-Brandenburg-104) The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects [church tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax#Germany "Church tax") on behalf of the churches. It does not keep records of members of other religious organizations which may collect their own church tax, in this way.

In 2009, approximately 249,000 [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") were reported by the [Office of Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amt_f%C3%BCr_Statistik_Berlin-Brandenburg "Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg") to be members of mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin,[\[126\]](#cite_note-127) while in 2016, the newspaper _[Der Tagesspiegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Tagesspiegel "Der Tagesspiegel")_ estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed [Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan "Ramadan") in Berlin.[\[127\]](#cite_note-Ramadan-128) In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the [Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Organization_of_Islamic_Cooperation "Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation").[\[103\]](#cite_note-Amt_für_Statistik_Berlin-Brandenburg-104)[\[127\]](#cite_note-Ramadan-128) Between 1992 and 2011 the Muslim population almost doubled.[\[128\]](#cite_note-129)

About 0.9% of Berliners belong to other religions. Of the estimated population of 30,000–45,000 Jewish residents,[\[129\]](#cite_note-130) approximately 12,000 are registered members of religious organizations.[\[125\]](#cite_note-Amt_für_Statistik_Berlin–Brandenburg-2010-126)

Berlin is the seat of the [Roman Catholic archbishop of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Berlin "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Berlin") and [EKBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Church_of_Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian_Upper_Lusatia "Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia")'s elected chairperson is titled the bishop of EKBO. Furthermore, Berlin is the seat of many Orthodox cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptist, one of the two seats of the [Bulgarian Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Orthodox_Church "Bulgarian Orthodox Church") Diocese of Western and Central Europe, and the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral of the Diocese of Berlin (Patriarchate of Moscow).

The faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many [places of worship in Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_of_worship_in_Berlin "List of places of worship in Berlin"). The [Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church "Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church") has eight parishes of different sizes in Berlin.[\[130\]](#cite_note-131) There are 36 [Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist "Baptist") congregations (within [Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Evangelical_Free_Church_Congregations_in_Germany "Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany")), 29 [New Apostolic Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Apostolic_Church "New Apostolic Church"), 15 [United Methodist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Methodist "United Methodist") churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four [Churches of Christ, Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Christ,_Scientist "Church of Christ, Scientist") (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"), an [Old Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Catholic "Old Catholic") church, and an [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican "Anglican") church in Berlin. Berlin has more than 80 mosques,[\[131\]](#cite_note-132) ten synagogues,[\[132\]](#cite_note-133) and two [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist") as well as four [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") temples.

[Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin "Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin")

Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (_Bezirke_). Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (_Ortsteile_), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called _[Kiez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiez "Kiez")_. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

Each borough is governed by a borough council (_Bezirksamt_) consisting of five councilors (_Bezirksstadträte_) including the borough's mayor (_Bezirksbürgermeister_). The council is elected by the borough assembly (_Bezirksverordnetenversammlung_). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (_Rat der Bürgermeister_), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

Berlin to this day maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.[\[141\]](#cite_note-142) [Town twinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city "Sister city") between [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin") and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles, California, in 1967. [East Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin")'s partnerships were canceled at the time of [German reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification "German reunification").

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The [President of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Germany "President of Germany"), whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the [German constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundgesetz "Grundgesetz"), has their official residence in [Bellevue Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Palace_(Germany) "Bellevue Palace (Germany)").[\[142\]](#cite_note-143) Berlin is the [seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_of_government "Seat of government") of the [German Chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany_(1949%E2%80%93) "Chancellor of Germany (1949–)") (Prime Minister), housed in the [Chancellery building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Chancellery_(Berlin) "Federal Chancellery (Berlin)"), the _Bundeskanzleramt_.

The [Berlin Hauptbahnhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Hauptbahnhof "Berlin Hauptbahnhof") (Berlin Central Station) is the largest [grade-separated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_separation "Grade separation") railway station in Europe.[\[193\]](#cite_note-194) The [Deutsche Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn "Deutsche Bahn") runs the high speed [Intercity-Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity-Express "Intercity-Express") (ICE) to domestic destinations, including [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg "Hamburg"), Munich, [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne "Cologne"), [Stuttgart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart "Stuttgart"), and [Frankfurt am Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_am_Main "Frankfurt am Main").

The [Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_(river) "Spree (river)") and the [Havel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel "Havel") rivers cross Berlin. There are no frequent passenger connections to and from Berlin by water. Berlin's largest harbour, the [Westhafen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westhafen "Westhafen"), is located in the district of [Moabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moabit "Moabit"). It is a transhipment and storage site for inland shipping with a growing importance.[\[194\]](#cite_note-195)

There is an increasing quantity of [intercity bus services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity_bus_service "Intercity bus service"). Berlin city has more than 10 stations[\[195\]](#cite_note-196) that run buses to destinations throughout Berlin.

Public transport in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20th-century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since 1989, the transport network has been developed extensively. However, it still contains early 20th century traits, such as the U1.[\[197\]](#cite_note-198)

[Berlin Brandenburg Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport "Berlin Brandenburg Airport") (BER) at night

Berlin is served by one commercial international airport: [Berlin Brandenburg Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport "Berlin Brandenburg Airport") (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing [Tegel Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tegel_Airport "Berlin Tegel Airport") (TXL) and [Schönefeld Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Sch%C3%B6nefeld_Airport "Berlin Schönefeld Airport") (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.[\[198\]](#cite_note-199) Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.[\[199\]](#cite_note-200) The planned initial capacity of around 27 million passengers per year[\[200\]](#cite_note-201) is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.[\[201\]](#cite_note-202)

Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as BER. Both airports together handled 29.5 million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.[\[202\]](#cite_note-203) Tegel Airport was a focus city for [Lufthansa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa") and [Eurowings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurowings "Eurowings") while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_(airline) "Germania (airline)"), [easyJet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet "EasyJet") and [Ryanair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair "Ryanair"). Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller [Tempelhof Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempelhof_Airport "Tempelhof Airport"), which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

From 1865 to 1976, Berlin operated an expansive [pneumatic postal network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube "Pneumatic tube"), reaching a maximum length of 400 kilometers (roughly 250 miles) by 1940. The system was divided into two distinct networks after 1949. The West Berlin system remained in public use until 1963, and continued to be utilized for government correspondence until 1972. Conversely, the East Berlin system, which incorporated the _Hauptelegraphenamt_—the central hub of the operation—remained functional until 1976.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant

Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm [Vattenfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vattenfall "Vattenfall") and the Berlin-based company [GASAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GASAG "GASAG"). Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg "Brandenburg").[\[203\]](#cite_note-204)

As of 2015[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit) the five [largest power plants measured by capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_Germany "List of power stations in Germany") are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these [power stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station "Power station") generate [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation "Electricity generation") and [useful heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.

In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [Autobahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn "Autobahn"), use overhead lines. The [Berlin 380-kV electric line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_380-kV_electric_line "Berlin 380-kV electric line") is the backbone of the city's energy grid.

Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the [fall of the Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall "Fall of the Berlin Wall") in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [counterculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture "Counterculture") gatherings.[\[246\]](#cite_note-247) The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, [Tresor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tresor_(club) "Tresor (club)") and [Berghain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berghain "Berghain").
